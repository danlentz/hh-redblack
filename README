hh-redblack

This package is a Common Lisp implemention of red-black trees (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-black_tree)
using the algorithms described in Introduction to Algorithms, by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, 
Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein.

In addition to a straight-forward in-memory implementation of red-black trees, an implementation of a persistent
tree is also included.  The persistent implementation uses a text file for storage (for human readability), and
uses an append-only strategy for updating that text file.  The only portion of the file that is ever written more
than once is the header (and its backup) that points to the current root of the tree.
